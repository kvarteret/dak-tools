## Generate Custom Post Type

The Generate Custom Post Type tool generates custom post types for Wordpress. The file uses a symbolic table that defines the identifications and titles of meta boxes to use and a variable to define the name of the post type. Based on this information this tool generates the custom post type plugin file with all the necessary functions. Each metabox is represented as a simple text input field in the administration panel in Wordpress.
